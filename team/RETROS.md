## Retro Assessment

We used the 4 L's structure. There were four sections in which people could post sticky notes; after all notes were created, we voted on them with dot voting, and discussed their themes in the order of highest votes first. These themes derived the action items.

I think it went reasonably well, except I was confused about the order in which to discuss the themes. Luckily Conrad suggested dot voting on the notes. I like that we came up with two action items.

For the next retro leader, I would say it's important to know how to synthesize small stories into a broad action item. And of course, it's also important to establish some priority of discussions, which I overlooked at first.
