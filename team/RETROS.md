## Action item structure

* A goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
* A change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
* A measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team acheive the goal, or move closer to it.

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

# Retro 04/20/20

* Led by: Alex Lancaster
* Present: Parth Atre, Alex Lancaster, Brian Qiu, Jeffrey Sun, Xinyi Zhang
* Absent: None

## Action Item: Time-wise schedule

* Goal: To make reasonable progress/ achieve the MVP in time
* Change: To create a schedule on when certain features will be produced
* Measurement: To use the schedule as a rough guideline

## Action Item: Subsection chat

* Goal: To improve the organization of the work
* Change: We will change the way we communicate: There will be subsections in the Slack based on the topic that we choose to work on;
everyone will be able to see all of these channels but they only contain relevant discussion of the channel's topic.

## Retro Assessment

We used the 4 L's structure. There were four sections in which people could post sticky notes; after all notes were created, we voted on them with dot voting, and discussed their themes in the order of highest votes first. These themes derived the action items.

I think it went reasonably well, except I was confused about the order in which to discuss the themes. Luckily Conrad suggested dot voting on the notes. I like that we came up with two action items.

For the next retro leader, I would say it's important to know how to synthesize small stories into a broad action item. And of course, it's also important to establish some priority of discussions, which I overlooked at first.

# Retro 05/11/20

* Led by: Jeffrey Sun
* Present: Alex Lancaster, Brian Qiu, Jeffrey Sun, Xinyi Zhang
* Absent: Parth Atre

## Action item: Testing

* a goal: add better testing to avoid bugs in the game and on the website
* a change: add TDD/unit-testing and do more multiplayer testing where multiple members are present
* a measurement: for every PR, multiple people should test it before it gets merged

## Action item: Keep code up-to-date

* a goal: keep code on other branches up-to-date with the code on the master branch to make merging PRs easier
* a change: notify others on slack whenever a PR is merged into master so that other PRs can rebase with master
* a measurement: PRs are rebased with master before being submitted for code review

## Brief description of how retro went

We used the Start-Stop-Continue outline for this week's retro. To implement the outline, we used an online post-it board divided into 3 regions for start, stop, and continue, and added post-it notes to each section. Then, we voted on notes to talk about and came up with action items based on the different notes. I thought it went okay, but I think I could have done a better job facilitating to keep the retro moving smoothly. It also seems like the stop and continue sections weren't really relevant to our discussion in the end. For the next leader, I think it would be good to have a rough idea about how long each part of the retro should take.
