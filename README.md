# How to run/develop 

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies (including next.js, Phaser, and socket.io).

2. a) If this is your first time running/you've made changes to the html (stuff unrelated to the game), run `npm run dev-build`. This automatically rebuilds the code with next and then starts up the server on localhost:3000.<br/><br/> b) If you've made changes to server.js but not the html, run `npm run dev-nobuild` to just restart the server.<br/><br/> c) If you've only made changes to game.js, a simple refresh should let you see the changes you've made without restarting the server.
