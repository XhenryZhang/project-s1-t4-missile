## Development Instructions

- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies (including next.js, Phaser, and socket.io).
- Use `npm run devsite` to make Next rebuild the pages and boot up the server on `localhost:3000`, which is necessary if you've made changes to any React components  
- Use `npm run devgame` to restart the server, which is necessary if changes were made to `server.js` or you want to reset the gamestate
- Refresh if all you need to do is see changes made in any of the static Javascript files rendered on the client side (any game related code besides `server.js`)

## Storybook Setup

1. Use `npm run storybook` to open React Storybook locally on localhost:6006.

2. Use `npm run build-storybook` to create a static storybook for Github Pages.
